1. List the execution time of the weblog aggregation query for Hive, SparkSQL, and SparkSQL on Parquet.
    Hive: 50.997 seconds
    SparkSQL: 9.507 seconds
    SparkSQL on Parquet: 3.138 seconds
2. How many jobs does:
    Hive launch? 2
    Does SparkSQL launch jobs? Yes
3. Write a query which joins weblogs_parquet to user_info and counts the top 5 locations. List the locations.

    SELECT location, COUNT(location) AS loc_count
        FROM user_info u
            INNER JOIN weblogs_parquet p
                ON u.user_id = p.user_id
        GROUP BY location
    ORDER BY loc_count DESC
    LIMIT 5;
