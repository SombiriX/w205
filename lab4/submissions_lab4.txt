q1. Try running len(distData); what happens, and why? 
    TypeError is thrown, this is specifically becuase <class 'pyspark.rdd.RDD'> has no len attribute or method. Likely, such a method is not applicable to this type of object.
SUBMISSION 1:
    Changed second lambda term to x[len(x.split(',')[0])+1:])
    narcoticsCrimeTuples = narcoticsCrimes.map(lambda x:(x.split(",")[0], x[len(x.split(',')[0])+1:]))
SUBMISSION 2:
    p1 = '"refereurl"'
    p2 = '"http://www.ebay.com"'
    query = "SELECT count(*) FROM Web_Session_Log WHERE {}={}".format(p1,p2)
    results = sqlContext.sql(query)
    results.show()
