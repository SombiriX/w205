The 10 measures below showed the highest variability from hospital to hospital within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services database. To determine these values 3 tables were analyzed, effective care, complications, and readmissions. Readmissions was excluded from the analysis because variation within the table is relatively low and would not show up in the top 10. Once the source tables were confirmed setting up the query was straightforward. The built-in variance function is used to  calculate variance for each group of measures and those measure variances are sorted to create the output table. Even though the variance treats non-numeric values as NULL removing non-numeric values from the data set aides in reducing unnecesary output from the parser.
